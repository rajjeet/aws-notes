Reservation model applicable for:
    - EC2 
    - RDS
    - ElastiCache
    - Redshift
    - DynamoDB

On-demand instances must match particular attributes to qualify for RI

When RI purchsed in specific AZ, it provides capacity reservation
	- capacity reservation - improves likelyhood of receiving in specific AZ when needed

Standard RI vs Convertible 
	- Convertible has to be 3 year commitment vs standard can be 1 or 3
	- Standard can only change size while CRI can change size, type, and family
	- CRI can only change platform, and tenacy

CRI useful when:
	- purchasing from payer's account
	- workloads likely to change
	- hedge against price drops
	- avoid capacity planning
	- predictable compute requirements 
	- CRI or SRI can be zonal or regional

Size flexibility isnt applicable when:
	- purchased for specific AZ
	- bare metal instances
	- dedicated tenancy 
	- Windows

Size flexibility available for linux based database instances and BYOL Oracle database.

Instance attribute used for discounting:
	- Instance type i.e. m4 t2
	- Platform - i.e. windows, ubuntu etc
	- Tenancy
	- Regional or Zonal

Good practice to enforce the use of specific ec2 configurations via AWS Config and AWS Service Catalog

Metrics in Cost Explorer:
	- EC2 RI Utilization % = RI used hours / total RI purchased hours
	- EC2 RI Converage % = RI used hours / total EC2 used hours

Relevant data in AWS Cost and Usage report"
	- Calculate savings = On-demand - discounted rate
	- RI discounts
