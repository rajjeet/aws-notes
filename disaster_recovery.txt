Recovery Time Objective (RTO) - time for DR solution to go live
Recovery Point Objective (RPO) - amount of acceptable data loss in terms of time

4 types of disaster recover:
	1. Backup and Restore
		- Backup and Restore
			+ Select AWS tool to backup data
			+ Select retention policy
			+ Verify security measures like encryption and access policies
			+ Testing and benchmarking restoration
	2. Pilot Light
		- Preparation
			+ Setup EC2 to mirror data
			+ Ensure software libraries available in AWS
			+ Maintain AMI with on-premises
			+ Build and test automation
		- Restoration
			+ Start EC2 from AMIs
			+ Vertically scale databases
			+ Add Multi-AZ to databases and added DR solution
			+ DNS point to new servers
			+ Boostrap unprepared AMIs
	3. Warm Standby
		- Preparation
			+ Setup EC2 to mirror data
			+ Maintain AMI with on-premises
			+ Run barebone setup of on-premises workload on AWS
			+ Keep software patches synced with on-premises
		- Restoration
			+ Horizontally and vertically scale running EC2 instances
			+ Update DNS records or configure health checks to failover to AWS
			+ Auto scale EC2 instances to right size 
			+ Add Multi-Az to databases and add DR solution
	4. Multi Site
		- Preparation
			+ Setup duplicate AWS environment to mirror on-premises
			+ Use DNS weighting to balance traffic b/w environments 
		- Restoration
			+ Auto scale EC2 instances to right size
			+ Application logic to use AWS data sources
			+ Adjust DNS weighting or use health checks to failover
