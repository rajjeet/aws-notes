The Cloud Computing Difference
	IT assets become programmable resources
	Global, availabile and unlimited capacity
	Higher level managed services
	Security built in

Design Principles
	+ Scalabilitiy
		- Scaling vertically
		- Scaling horizontally
			- Staleless applications
			- Push (ELB) vs pull (SQS) model
	+ Disposable resources instead of fixed servers
		- Instantiating compute resources
			- Boostrapping
			- Golden images
			- Docker containers
			- Configuration management tools (Chef, Puppet)
		- Infrastructure as code
			- Programmable infrastructure (CloudFormation)
	+ Automation
		- AWS Elastic Beanstalk - upload app code and done
		- Amazon EC2 Auto recovery - recover impaired EC2 instances
		- Auto Scaling
		- CloudWatch Alarms
		- CloudWatch Events
		- AWS Opsworks lifecycle events - configure events
		- AWS Lambda scheduled events
	+ Loose coupling
		- Well-Defined interfaces
			- API Gateway
		- Service Discovery
			- ELB
			- Route53
		- Asynchronous Integration
			- SQS
			- Kinesis
			- SWF
		- Graceful Failure
	+ Services, not servers
		- Managed services
		- Serverless architectures
	+ Databases
		- Relational - joins, complex transactions, and dynamic access patterns
		- NoSQL - scalability over flexible schema and predetermined fixed access pattern
		- Data warehouses - analytics and reporting on large datasets 
		- Search - full text searching 
	+ Removing single points of failure
		- Introduce redundancy
			- Standby redundency (failover)
				- stateful components
			- Active redundency (distribtion)
		- Detect failure
		- Durable data store
			- Synchronous replication
			- Asynchronous replication
			- Quorum-based replication
		- Automated multi-data center resilience
			- Availability Zones and regions 
		- Fault isolation and tradititonal horizontal scaling 
			- Shuffle sharding 
	+ Optimizing for cost
		- Right Sizing
		- Elasticity
		- Purchasing Options
			- Reserved Capacity
			- Spot Instances
			- Bidding strategy
			- Mix with On-demand
			- Spot blocks for defined duration workloads
	+ Caching
		- Application data caching 
		- Edge caching for static content	
	+ Security
		- Utilize AWS features for defense in depth
		- Offload security responsibility to AWS
		- Reduce priviliged access
			- IAM Roles or Federation
			- Cognito
		- Security as code
			- CloudFormation
			- AWS Service Catalog
